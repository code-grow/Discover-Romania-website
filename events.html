                    <h3>George Enescu Festival</h3>
                    <p>Every two years (odd years), Bucharest hosts one of Europe's most prestigious classical music festivals. Named after Romania's greatest composer, the George Enescu Festival brings together world-renowned orchestras, conductors, and soloists for three weeks in September. Performances take place at the Romanian Athenaeum, the Palace Hall, and other venues across Bucharest. The 2025 edition promises performances by the Vienna Philharmonic, London Symphony Orchestra, and legendary soloists. Beyond the main concerts, the festival includes chamber music, contemporary compositions, and educational programs.</p>
                    
                    <p>The festival's history dates back to 1958, created to honor George Enescu's legacy as composer, violinist, and conductor. His Romanian Rhapsodies remain among the most beloved pieces of Romanian classical music. The festival has evolved into a cultural phenomenon, with over 150,000 attendees and performances extending to other Romanian cities. Early booking is essential as tickets for major performances sell out months in advance. The festival atmosphere transforms Bucharest into a classical music capital, with street performances and related cultural events.</p>

                    <h3>Seasonal Traditions</h3>
                    <p><strong>MƒÉr»õi»ôor (March 1st)</strong> - This ancient celebration marks the beginning of spring. Romanians exchange small tokens called mƒÉr»õi»ôoare - red and white strings with decorative charms symbolizing life and renewal. Women and girls wear these talismans throughout March, then hang them on fruit trees for good luck. Cities host spring festivals with traditional music, crafts markets, and cultural performances celebrating winter's end.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Easter Traditions</strong> - Romanian Orthodox Easter (date varies) features unique customs blending Christian and pre-Christian elements. The midnight Resurrection service sees thousands gathering with candles, creating rivers of light through city streets. Traditional foods include lamb, drob (organ meat pudding), and pascƒÉ (sweet bread with cheese). The famous painted eggs of Bucovina, decorated using wax-resist techniques, are true works of art. Easter Monday's tradition of boys sprinkling girls with perfume or water ensures beauty throughout the year.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Christmas Traditions</strong> - The winter holiday season begins December 6th with St. Nicholas Day and extends through Epiphany. Carol singers (colindƒÉtori) go door-to-door performing ancient songs for good luck. The Capra (Goat Dance) and Ursul (Bear Dance) preserve pre-Christian winter solstice rituals with elaborate costumes and masks. Christmas markets in major cities feature traditional crafts, mulled wine, and seasonal treats like cozonac (sweet bread) and turtƒÉ dulce (gingerbread).</p>

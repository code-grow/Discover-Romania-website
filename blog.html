                    <h3>48 Hours in Medieval Transylvania</h3>
                    <p class="blog-meta">By Sarah Mitchell | November 15, 2024 | 5 min read</p>
                    <p>The morning mist clung to the Carpathian peaks as our train wound through the mountains toward Brașov. After months of planning, I was finally experiencing the Transylvania I'd dreamed about - and it exceeded every expectation. This wasn't the dark, foreboding land of vampire legends, but a region alive with color, warmth, and centuries of fascinating history.</p>
                    
                    <p>Brașov's medieval charm hit immediately. Stepping into Council Square felt like entering a fairytale - pastel-colored baroque buildings surrounding the imposing Black Church, Europe's largest Gothic church between Vienna and Istanbul. I climbed the old city walls for panoramic views, then got wonderfully lost in the narrow cobblestone streets. The Saxon influence is everywhere, from architecture to the hearty food at Bella Musica, where I enjoyed the best goulash of my life while listening to a violin serenade.</p>
                    
                    <p>Day two brought the obligatory visit to Bran Castle. Yes, it's touristy, but arriving at opening time meant having Dracula's supposed castle almost to myself. The morning light streaming through medieval windows, the creaking wooden floors, the stunning valley views - it was magical. But the real discovery was Râșnov Citadel, just 15 minutes away. This 13th-century fortress, perched dramatically on a hilltop, offered incredible views and a more authentic medieval experience without the crowds.</p>

                    <h3>Money Matters</h3>
                    <p>ATMs are everywhere in cities, but rural areas still run on cash. Exchange money at banks for best rates, never on the street. Tipping 10% is standard in restaurants. Many places accept euros but at poor rates - always pay in lei when possible.</p>

                    <p>Learn "Mulțumesc" (thank you) and "Bună ziua" (hello) - Romanians appreciate the effort. Download Google Translate offline. In Transylvania, German or Hungarian might be more useful than English in some villages.</p>

                    <p>Eat where locals eat - look for "Gospodina" restaurants. Try mici at street stalls, not restaurants. Order țuică when offered - refusing can offend. Vegetarians: say "de post" (fasting food) for meat-free options during Orthodox fasting periods.</p>

                    <h3>Interview: A Transylvanian Shepherd's Life</h3>
                    <p class="blog-meta">October 5, 2024 | Interview by Michael Brown</p>
                    <p>Gheorghe has spent 40 years shepherding in the Carpathians, following the same routes his grandfather used. Over țuică in his mountain cabin, he shared stories of wolf encounters, traditional cheese-making, and watching Romania transform while his mountains remained unchanged.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Tourists come looking for Dracula," he laughs, "but they find something better - real life that hasn't changed in centuries. My sheep don't know about vampires, only about good grass and clean water. The mountains teach patience. City people need to remember this."</p>
                    
                    <p>His daily routine begins at dawn, checking the flock and making traditional cheese that sells in Brașov's markets. Bears are regular visitors ("They're more afraid of my dogs than I am of them"), and he's witnessed the return of wolves to areas where they'd vanished decades ago. Despite hardships, he wouldn't trade this life: "The mountains are in our blood. My son works in Bucharest but comes back every summer. The mountains always call us home."</p>

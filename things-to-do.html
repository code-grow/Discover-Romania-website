                    <h3>Mountain Adventures</h3>
                    <p>The Carpathian Mountains offer year-round adventure opportunities that rival any European destination. In summer, over 15,000 kilometers of marked trails wind through pristine forests, alpine meadows, and dramatic peaks. The Transylvanian Alps provide challenging multi-day treks, including the famous ridge walk along the Făgăraș Mountains, Romania's highest range. For a unique experience, try the Via Ferrata routes in Bicaz Gorge or Zărnești, where secured climbing routes make vertical adventures accessible to beginners.</p>
                    
                    <p>Winter transforms the mountains into a skiing paradise with over 40 ski resorts. Poiana Brașov, Romania's premier resort, offers 24 kilometers of slopes suitable for all levels, modern lifts, and prices significantly lower than Western European resorts. Sinaia, the "Pearl of the Carpathians," combines skiing with royal history, while smaller resorts like Păltiniș and Vatra Dornei offer intimate mountain experiences. Cross-country skiing and snowshoeing provide peaceful alternatives for exploring winter landscapes.</p>

                    <h3>Wildlife Watching</h3>
                    <p>Romania offers Europe's best wildlife watching opportunities. The Carpathians shelter 60% of Europe's brown bear population, along with wolves, lynx, and wild boar. Professional wildlife hides near Brașov and Harghita allow safe bear watching, especially during spring and autumn when bears are most active. Early morning tracking expeditions in Piatra Craiului National Park might reveal chamois, deer, and if you're lucky, wolf tracks in fresh snow.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Danube Delta is a birdwatcher's paradise with over 300 species. Spring migration (April-May) brings millions of birds, while summer offers pelican colonies and rare species like the pygmy cormorant. Professional guides navigate the maze of channels to reach the best viewing spots. The autumn migration in September-October is equally spectacular, with massive flocks of cranes, geese, and ducks stopping to rest.</p>

Mountain biking trails crisscross the Carpathians, from gentle forest paths to technical singletracks.

                        <p>Rivers flowing from the Carpathians create excellent conditions for rafting and kayaking. The Jiu River offers Class III-IV rapids during spring snowmelt, while the Buzău River provides gentler family-friendly floating. The Black Sea coast offers windsurfing, kitesurfing, and sailing, particularly around Mamaia. Lake Vidraru and Lake Bicaz provide calm waters for stand-up paddleboarding and fishing in spectacular mountain settings.</p>
